                A widely-used facial recognition algorithm from pre-CNN
                (Convolutional Neural Network) times, Viola-Jones works by
                scanning faces and extracting features that are then passed
                through a boosting classifier. This, in turn, generates a number
                of boosted classifiers that are used to check test images. For a
                successful match to be found, a test image must generate a
                positive result from each of these classifiers.
